Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.
I congratulate him on his excellent report.
I should like to make just a few comments.
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.
We need to take this responsibility seriously.
We need a public debate on this.
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.
